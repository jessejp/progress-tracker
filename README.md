# Progress Tracker app

### Description of features

An app to track weightlifting progress by having the user **add an exercise** with the weight, repetitions and sets values.

After doing their workout, user can then submit the completed exercises and update the mass, reps or sets values to where they want to progress next.

From the graphs page, user can see progress submitted in a graph.

Currently I've scoped the app to just track weight training exercises, but I'm looking to expand it by letting the user add categories and customize the trackable data parameters.

#### Running the app

You can [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository or download as zip, then locating the folder in the terminal: running `npm install` to install all required dependencies. `npm start` to start development server.
